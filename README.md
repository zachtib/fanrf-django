# fanrf-django

This is a small web project to wrap [fanrf](https://github.com/tylerwhall/fanrf) in a responsive webapp

an example start.sh script is provide to get up and running, currently just using the django debug server, which is most likely sufficient for local network operation, but shouldn't be used for anything larger.
